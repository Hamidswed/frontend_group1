                3.Sahira -> productItem added add to favourite logic,search,Favourite item and Favourite List Component. Used redux slice part for component logics and applied local storage in slice.
                4. Jacob -> worked in productDetail,Filterd Product components using redux logic in slice .
Git Issues managed by using each branch for each component. Then push by git push origin branch name. After that approved by group members merge it . When we need new updated data
pull it by git pull origin main.
Design: We don't use more CSS file, Every task is done in App.css. We only created one folder for connected componets. We applied each logic from parent to child. We maximum created more components for each pages.
Group Project: It was very useful to understand git branch, pull and merge. It was very helpful how to interact with a whole project a person. The component division was very useful for individual work.
